# ML Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of a 
categorical dependent variable. In logistic regression, the dependent variable is a binary variable that contains 
data coded as 1 (yes, success, etc.) or 0 (no, failure, etc.). In other words, the logistic regression 
model predicts P(Y=1) as a function of X.

## Objective:
The purpose of this assignment is to apply Logistic regression to classify a binary value or categorical value  . 
and also discuss why we chose that attribute/feature and what we are trying to learn from the classification.

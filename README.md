# ML-LogisticRegression
Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of a 
categorical dependent variable. In logistic regression, the dependent variable is a binary variable that contains 
data coded as 1 (yes, success, etc.) or 0 (no, failure, etc.). In other words, the logistic regression 
model predicts P(Y=1) as a function of X.
